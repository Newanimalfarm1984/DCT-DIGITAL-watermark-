# DCT-DIGITAL-watermark-
The digital watermarking of DCT algorithm based on Arnold scrambling, which utilize Matlab as a programming tool, it is programmed to achieve and developed a related research. The watermarking image is reconstructed by Arnold, and then the DCT is carried out the watermark image and the host image. The embedding of the watermark is carried out, and the host image is embedded in the watermark to obtain the carrier image. The watermark is extracted by the carrier image and the original host image, then the DCT coefficients of the carrier image are obtained and the DCT coefficients of the host image are obtained. Then, we compare the watermark image to be extracted on the carrier image and the host image. After the DCT inverse transform and Arnold anti-scrambling are carried out, the extracted watermark image. Utilizing the telescopic, rotate, add the Gaussian noise and other attacks to verify the watermark of the anti-attack. The simulation results demonstrate that the algorithm can achieve the requirement of robustness and invisibility. the algorithm is safe that the anti-attack performance of the watermark is superior to the general DCT algorithm.
